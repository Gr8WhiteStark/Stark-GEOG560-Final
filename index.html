    <strong>Annotation:</strong>
    The data rich environment created by Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an ideal starting place for facilities management. The authors examined the requirements of 3D GIS and created a preliminary model that integrated BIM and GIS functionalities to provide a strong tool for facilities management. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    This paper was exactly the kind of information I'm looking for in my day-to-day work. We have an ever expanding library of BIM data, and are looking to find ways to get the most out of it, since hosting the data and licensing the software to interact with it is expensive. Getting as much use out of our data as possible is important. Integrating GIS and BIM also provides a pathway for non-BIM users to interact with BIM data in an environment that is more user-friendly and simple.

    <strong>Annotation:</strong>
    The author wanted to review current GIS solutions to examine their suitability for managing space in a library. Due to the capability of GIS tools to analyze spatial data and create interactive information, the goal of this paper was to show the process of developing, implementing, maintaining, and utilizing a GIS system for academic libraries. The conclusion was that GIS technology is an extremely effective and efficient tool for managing space in an academic library.
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    This study provides some proof of concept for similar projects to ones like what would be run at my workplace. One of the buildings in our portfolio is a library that's been open since 1939. The article also offered a deep insight into some of the challenges of using GIS as a space management tool. My biggest takeaway was the complexity involved in creating CAD drawings to have something build from.

    <strong>Annotation:</strong>
    The purpose of the project this article discusses is to design an application that allows management of physical spaces of one of the facilities of the University of La Salle throughout the framework of pose-COVID-19 reopening. In order to provide adequate information about the risk levels related to reopening, an ArcGIS Indoors Application was created that allowed users to view areas where positive cases of COVID-19 had been reported, and then view the corresponding risk level by cross referencing the path taken through the facility by the positive case and themselves. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    Implementation of an Indoors Application has a lot of potential use cases. When multiple data types are available (CAD, BIM, GIS, etc.) indoor GIS models are an effective way to bring them together. ArcGIS Indoors also provides good methods of keeping data up-to-date as changes are made or user inputs are requested.

    This presentation was created to demonstrate the functionality available by integrating TRIRIGA and ESRI's space management tools. The resulting design is highly available, scalable, flexible, intuitive, and provides users the ability to locate buildings, rooms, people, and environmental health and safety risks/events. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    TRIRIGA is an extremely versitile integrated workplace management system (IWMS). It combines the functionality of many other softwares, and builds on the effectiveness of others, like ArcGIS Indoors. I'm working on an Indoors application now that will eventually be tied in with TRIRIGA so that the maps can be utlilized my staff to interact with asset management softwares, as well as other fiscal management portions of the software like facilities condition assesment (FCA) reporting.

    <strong>Annotation:</strong>
    Very recent work combining BIM, GIS, and Asset Management systems to manage a comprehensive portfolio at University of Turin (Italy). Work showed the combination of tools to be a suitable digital representation of the University's assets and personell data, allowing facilities administrators to make suitable planning decisions based on representative data. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    Multiple tools are required to create strong "digital twin" environment. The better the model, the better the decision making workflow dependent on the model. The authors also demonstrate the repeatability of the process and show a wide range of suitability beyond just the university setting.

    <strong>Annotation:</strong>
    This article presents a case for the use of GIS tools during the construction phase of a project with a focus on future facility management. Current trends in the construction industry in the Czech Republic point to GIS tools being largely ignored throughout the construction process. However, the tools provide so much functionality to owners, construction contractors, and project managers that the authors believe usage of the tools will only grow and expand over time. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    If GIS tools were implemented during construction phases of projects, there are a lot of implication for property owners. Accountability is a big one for contractors doing work on behalf of Government entities. If these tools and systems were portfolio wide and implemented at handoff from construction projects, it would provide property owners the opportunity to run further analyses and monitor facility health going forward.

    This case study examines the use of BIM and GIS data for simulating facilities maintenance management on one of the campuses of the University of Cantabira in Spain. A BIM model was created in Revit, then integrated with ArcGIS Pro to create a "Digital Twin" of the facility. The next step in creating a functioning model of a facility is creating maintenance activities the facilities team wants to monitor throughout the life of the facility. The authors concluded that the digital twin of the facility enabled the team to simulate various scenarios that may arise in their physical counterparts. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    Digital twins of facilities is exactly what I would like to implement with the facilities team I work in. The ability to simulate maintenance scenarios and plan accordingly would be extremely valuable for determining priority of deferred maintenance items during budgeting phases of capitol construction and renovation.

    <strong>Annotation:</strong>
    The authors of this publication communicated the details of the process of converting CAD drawings to be usable in GIS programs like ArcGIS Pro. The process can be complicated, and can create issues if not done correctly. The goal of the conversion involves removing data from "data silos" and populating repositories that are accessible to all. In the case of this study, converting data from CAD to GIS also enabled the users to input the data into the asset management system, which was not possible with CAD data. The authors reccomended the following workflow: Collect data, clean data, import data into GIS, georeference the data, and then clean the newly georeference data so that any errors have been cleaned up and dealt with. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    This workflow was employed to convert the library of CAD drawings selected to be included in our ArcGIS Indoors model. The authors of this article are certainly correct in stating how important following this procedure properly is. Any deviation from the expected work flow creates headache at later steps by interfering with downstream processes. However, completing everything as it's suggested creates a relatively seamless experience that can be easily replicated and applied across portfolios.

    Rising admissions at higher education institutions in China have resulted in many colleges and universities constructing and moving into mixed-use highrise facilities, which places additional pressure on space management infrastructure. Unused space at night, particularly lab space increases risk and undermines sustainability efforts taken by these institutions. The authors were tasked with identifying nighttime usage, and presented a unique method of detection. Using security cameras, light brightness was measured and associated with building occupancy with an accuracy of 98.67%. 
    <strong>Relevance to Career:</strong>
    With return to work initiatives and sustainability efforts conflicting, my employer is turning to data aquisition to determine the best compromise going forward into the new hybrid work environment. Several options for measuring occupancy have been explored, and are being tested in some of our facilities.
